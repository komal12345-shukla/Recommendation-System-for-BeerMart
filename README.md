As a sales manager for "BeerMart", an online beer store in the United States. I have to build a recommendation system (collaborative) for my store, where customers will be recommended the beer that they are most likely to buy. 


I need to perform the following tasks:

Data preparation

  1. Choose only those beers that have at least N number of reviews.Figure out an appropriate value of N using EDA; this may not have one correct answer, but you should not            choose beers that have an extremely low number of ratings.
  2. Data exploration
  3. What are the unique values of ratings?

Visualise the rating values and notice:
  The average beer ratings
  The average user ratings
  The average number of ratings given to the beers
  The average number of ratings given by the users
  Recommendation Models
  Dividing data into training and testing dataset.
  Build user-based and item-based models.
  Determine how similar the first 10 users are to each other and visualise it.
  Compute and visualise the similarity between the first 10 beers.
  Compare the performance of the two models using test data and suggest the one that should be deployed.
  Give the names of the top 5 beers that you would recommend to the users 'cokes', 'genog' and 'giblet' using both the models.
